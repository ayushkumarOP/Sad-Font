# Introduction:

The need to communicate sadness to other people or text is important even when we live in the times where everything is done using the computer. While words can do a lot in this case, they may not be enough to convey human feelings solely with texts. In response to this, I designed a unique sad font aiming at sadness, depression, and contemplation allowing poets and designers to help themselves with emotional narratives.

# Design Decisions:
Several key design decisions were made to ensure the font conveys a sense of sadness:
## Rounded Edges and Drooping Lines: 
To evoke a gentle, downcast feeling, the font features rounded edges and drooping lines that mimic the natural posture of sadness.
## Subtle Curves and Asymmetry: 
Incorporating subtle curves and slight asymmetry adds a touch of imperfection, reflecting the natural, unpolished state of human emotions.
## Integrated Sad Faces: 
Incorporating sad facial cues directly into some letters further emphasizes the emotional theme, making the font uniquely expressive.
## Soft Strokes: 
The use of soft strokes rather than sharp, rigid lines helps maintain a delicate and emotional appearance.
## Spacing and Alignment: 
Thoughtful spacing and slightly irregular alignment contribute to the overall feeling of disquiet, as perfectly aligned text would feel too orderly and contradict the intended mood.
