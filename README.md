#Introduction:
The need to communicate sadness to other people or text is important even when we live in the times where everything is done using the computer. While words can do a lot in this case, they may not be enough to convey human feelings solely with texts. In response to this, I designed a unique sad font aiming at sadness, depression, and contemplation allowing poets and designers to help themselves with emotional narratives.
